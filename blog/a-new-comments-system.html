<p>I've made a little comments system for this blog, and it gave me a chance to look a bit more into <a href="http://www.phpdoctrine.org/">Doctrine</a>.</p>

<p>I keep meaning to blog about how I put this site together, but for now I'll just say that it uses Zend Framework for MVC, with Doctrine for the ORM.  To implement the comments form I used <a href="http://codeutopia.net/blog/2008/06/02/autogenerating-forms-from-doctrine-models/">a great bit of code from CodeUtopia</a>, written by <span class="vcard"><a href="http://codeutopia.net/blog/about/" class="url fn">Jani Hartikainen</a> (a.k.a. 'zomg' on IRC)</span> that ties together Doctrine objects and Zend_Form in quite a nice way.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to do a quite simple tutorial about how to implement a small blog, but that's for another time when I'm not busy revising for my ZCE!</p>
