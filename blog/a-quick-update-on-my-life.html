<p>Seeing as I'm updating, here's what's going on with me lately:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've written an article for <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|Architect</a> - not sure if I'm meant to say what it's about, but it should be in the August issue.</li>
<li>I left <a href="http://www.propertymall.com">PropertyMall</a> after four years, to move on to pastures new as a freelancer.</li>
<li>After 6 weeks of contracting, and enjoying the freedom, I had a couple of interviews at <a href="http://www.beam.tv">Beam.tv</a>.</li>
<li>The upshot of which is, I'll be starting at Beam on Monday! I'm very much looking forward to it.</li> 
</ul>
