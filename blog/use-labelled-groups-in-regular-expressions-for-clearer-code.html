<p>I keep seeing this sort of pattern in PHP code, when people match on Regular Expressions:

<p><code><pre>
$orderNumber = 'CLK-TEST001-030';
$pattern = '/([a-z]+)-([a-z]+([0-9]+))?-([0-9]+)/i';

if (preg_match($pattern , $orderNumber, $matches)) {
    echo "Prefix was ".$matches[1]." and duration was ".$matches[4];
} 
</pre></code></p>

<p>The problem here is that the numbers 4 and 1 are kind of cryptic. Furthermore if the expression changes in future I'll probably need to go through my code and redo the numbering.

<p>A better alternative is to name the groups inside the expression:

<p><code><pre>
$orderNumber = 'CLK-TEST001-030';
$pattern = '/(?&lt;prefix&gt;[a-z]+)-([a-z]+([0-9]+))?-(?&lt;duration&gt;[0-9]+)/i';

if (preg_match($pattern , $orderNumber, $matches)) {
    echo "Prefix was ".$matches['prefix'].
        " and duration was ".$matches['duration'];
} 
</pre></code></p>

<p>This way if the expression gets changed, I can still use the same named fields in my matches in the subsequent code.

<p>I don't know why this isn't done more often, except perhaps poor documentation means that people just aren't aware of it?
