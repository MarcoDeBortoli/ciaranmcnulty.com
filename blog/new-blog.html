<p>I've been blogging about personal stuff on LiveJournal for a few years now, but I've become more and more disillusioned with using third-party blogging, and the 'audience' there isn't that interested in anything technical.</p>

<p>Because of that I've decided to start blogging about tech issues here on my own site starting today - I hope to add a few more bloggish features like tags/comments/permalinks, but frankly I figured I'd just get obsessed making that work and not write anything.</p>
