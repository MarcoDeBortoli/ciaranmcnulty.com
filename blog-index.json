A 301 means \"moved permanently\", and in the case of so-called canonical URLs, nothing has moved. The Content-Location header also seems inappropriate, but then my reading of the paragraph from RFC2616 seems to be the complete opposite of yours! I interpret the semantic as being \"here's this other location, I got the relevant stuff from there just now, but it might move\" which is far from what canonical URLs are trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe Content-Location header seems to be more approriate for implementation of content-negotation, as in this paper:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/cooluris\/#conneg\r\n\r\nI realise that I'm not offering any constructive alternatives, but then I tend also to subscribe to the philosophy that if you need this device in the first place, you're probably doing it wrong. \r\n","created":"2009-02-16 15:39:50"},{"name":"Ciaran McNulty","website":"http:\/\/ciaranmcnulty.com","comment":"Thanks for the comments, Simon.\r\n\r\nI indeed hadn't realised Yahoo! and MS had both implemented the same thing, and the Google announcement I linked to didn't seem to mention it either!  I do wonder how they agree these things.\r\n\r\nI'm also quite interested in your interpretation of content-location.  It's one of those little-used headers so maybe I need to re-read and do some more research on what exactly it means, it's entirely possible you're right.\r\n\r\nHowever, I disagree on a couple of points:\r\n\r\n1. The 301 status may be defined as 'Moved Permanently' but there's some wiggle room in that. \r\n\r\nIn the RFC it says the resource has been moved. I would argue that clearly there was a resource there, because somebody has been able to construct a URL for it.  I don't think that the existence of a past specific representation of that resource is 100% necessary, though clearly this is a bit pedantic.\r\n\r\nThe other argument I'd make is that it's very common to set up a newly-registered domain to 301 redirect to another domain, without first taking time to establish a site there, so common usage of the 301 semantic might have evolved since the RFC was written.\r\n\r\n2. I certainly don't think this counts as 'adapting HTML'.  HTML4 specifically allows any values you like for @rel, and even encourages you to develop your own semantics.  However, if you start defining your own semantics HTML4 says you SHOULD add a @profile to your <HTML>, which this proposal doesn't suggest.  It's a slap-on-the-wrists rather than an error though.\r\n\r\nCertainly defining new @rel\/@rev values to mean specific things is not new, so even if you disagree you may have missed the boat! \r\n","created":"2009-02-16 15:53:22"},{"name":"Ciaron Dunne","website":"http:\/\/www.broadbandgenie.co.uk","comment":"Where this will be useful (unless I'm misunderstanding it) is for shops where you inevitably get a large number of pages with extremely similar content. For example, if you've sorted by price or filtered by colour using text links then the URL might change and the new page would be accessible by Google. You really don't want to confuse Google, so it's a nice way of reminding it which is the master page. Previously this has been handled by nofollow and noindex, but this way seems more elegant - rather than excluding the pages, just communicate the hierarchy to Google.","created":"2009-02-20 11:22:12"}]},"simplifying-file-operations-using-php-stream-wrappers":{"title":"Simplifying file operations using PHP stream wrappers","created":"2009-04-02 10:59:18","url":"simplifying-file-operations-using-php-stream-wrappers","tags":["php","web"],"comments":[{"name":"Russell","website":"http:\/\/rdjs.co.uk","comment":"I have not used stream wrappers before but will certainly give them a try next time.
