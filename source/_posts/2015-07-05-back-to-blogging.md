Wow, it's been a while! I honestly can't believe it's been nearly 3.5 years since I last wrote a blog post. A few things
have happened in that time:

 * I left [The Mill / Beam][1] and moved to an awesome job at [Inviqa][2], where I'm now mostly doing training and coaching
 * I got involved with, and subsequently took over maintainence of [PhpSpec][3], a tool I thought was really cool
 * I started speaking at meetups and conferences (I need to find somewhere on this site to store links to videos)
 * I got married (gearing up for that was the initial reason I didn't have time to write much)

In short, my professional life has changed hugely. I guess I'm now back in a place where I feel I can write longer-form stuff
for a blog.

I keep promising work that I'll write articles for either the Inviqa or Sensio Labs UK sites, so will link out to there when
appropriate, but I wanted to have a place I could dash stuff off without editors being involved.

So, I spent this morning switching the site over to the very cool [Sculpin][4], and started a few draft posts that I'll be pushing
out in the future. At some point I'll rejig the site's layout so it's a lot easier to find older content.

My aim is to produce 1 blog per month. Will I stick to it? Time will tell...
