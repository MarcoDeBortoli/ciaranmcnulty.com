<p>Today saw <a href="http://fifteensquared.net/2008/07/22/guardian-24447araucaria-in-hot-water/">my debut over at Fifteensquared</a> as one of their daily crossword blogging team.  About once a week I'll be blogging a solution for the Guardian crossword, hopefully reasonably early on the day of publication.</p>

<p>It's been an interesting experience.  On a normal day I'll buy the Guardian in the morning and do a couple of clues on the way in to work, then have it sitting on my desk for an occasional glance through the morning.  When I have a free lunch I'll finish it off, usually with a bit of help from <a href="http://www.paulgoodwin.com">Paul</a> if he's online.  I hadn't realised how much pressure I'd be adding to myself by committing to solve it on a certain day.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning in a vague panic about whether I'd manage to fit it in. When I got the paper at my local corner shop, I turned straight to the crossword page and my heart sank - today's setter was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galbraith_Graham">Araucaria</a>, possibly the hardest setter the Guardian use and certainly the most inventive.  I normally consider it a bit of a triumph to finish his puzzles by the end of the day, let alone in the morning.</p>

<p>I calmed down once on the train and cracking on with the puzzle - it seemed far easier than normal, or perhaps I was concentrating a lot harder. I managed about 2/3 of it on the way into work, and a bit of googling once at my desk polished it off.  I fee like I've dodged a bit of a bullet for now, but I'm painfully aware that I'll have to do the whole thing again pretty soon</p>

<p>What have I got myself into?</p>
