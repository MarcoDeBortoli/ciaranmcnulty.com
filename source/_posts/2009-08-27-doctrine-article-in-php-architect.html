<p>Ah, fame at last!</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="http://phparch.com/c/phpa/magazine/index">the new issue of php|architect</a> is out, and contains my article about <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation">Doctrine</a>, the PHP-based Object Relational Mapper.</p>

<p>It feels like ages since I wrote it (I'm no longer a 'freelance PHP developer' for a start) so re-reading it was actually a slightly weird experience.</p>
</div>
<p>It's my first published work, and I'm fairly happy with it.  Hopefully I'll get another chance to write for php|architect, I just need to think of another subject that I have something to say about.</p>

<p>The bad news for most of you cheapskates is that php|architect is a subscription-only publication so you can't read my article for free!  However, I would genuinely recommend the magazine, especially as it's only effectively $2.50/issue.  Obviously I wouldn't recommend it for people who aren't interested in PHP, however!</p>
