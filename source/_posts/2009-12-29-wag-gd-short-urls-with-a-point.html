title: Wag.gd - short URLs with a point
tags: [ mobile,web ]
---
<p>Short URLs are a bit of a hot-button topic amongst devs - some think they're useful (like <a href="http://rdjs.co.uk/web/Implement-revcanonical-and-become-supercool/4" rel="friend">Russell</a>), some are wary of them (like <a href="http://ciaranmcnulty.com/blog/2009/04/rev-canonical-should-be-handled-with-care" rel="me">me</a>) and some, like my friend <a href="http://pointbeing.net/" rel="friend">Simon</a>, rail against them as a waste of time and resource.</p>

<p>Simon, however, is a sensible sort so rather than just making lots of noise about how they suck, he's gone away and tried to think of a sensible use case, then implemented it.</p>

<p>So take a look over at <a href="http://wag.gd">Wag.gd</a> if you're interested in mobile development.  <a href="http://pointbeing.net/weblog/2009/12/mobile-friendly-short-urls-with-waggd.html">Simon's written about it</a> far better than I could and it's certainly an interesting idea.</p>
