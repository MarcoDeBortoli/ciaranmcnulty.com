<p>Sorry for the lack of recent posts - I've been distracted recently working on an article I've written for <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">php|architect</a>.</p>

<p>In theory it'll be in the August issue but these things are subject to change and frankly they could probably still reject it if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Anyway there's still time to subscribe if you want to get a copy!</p>
